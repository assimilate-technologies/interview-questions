                            Angular is the most popular web development framework for developing mobile apps as well as
                            desktop applications.<br>
                            The angular framework is also utilized in the cross-platform mobile development called IONIC
                            and so it is not limited to web apps only.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Angular is an open source framework written and maintained by the angular team at Google and
                            the Father of Angular is Misko Hevery.

                            Angular is written in TypeScript and so it comes with all the capabilities that typescript
                            offers.

                        <strong>What's New in Angular 13?</strong>
                        <p>
                            Angular 14 is finally here after the success of its predecessor Angular 13. 
                            The Type-script based web application framework is the next significant Google release. <br>
                            Angular 14 has arrived with stand-alone components, promising to streamline Angular app development by reducing the need for Angular modules. The upgrade from Angular 13 to Angular 14 induces new opportunities for typed forms, improved template diagnosis, and stand-alone components.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Angular 14 is believed to be the most systematic pre-planned upgrade by Angular. The Angular 14 release new features include CLI auto-completion, typed reactive forms, stand-alone components, directives and pipes, and enhanced template diagnostics.<br><br>
                            he highlight of this update is that the Angular team has carefully seasoned out the need for Ng modules, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required to start the application.

                        <p> Components are the most basic building block of a UI in Angular applications and it controls
                            views (HTML/CSS). They also communicate with other components and services to bring
                            functionality to your applications.<br/>
                            Technically components are basically TypeScript classes that interact with the HTML files of
                            the components, which get displayed on the browsers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The component is the core functionality of Angular applications but you need to know to pass
                            the data into the components to configure them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Angular applications must have a root component that contains all other components.
                        </p>

                            Components are created using @Component decorator that is part of @angular/core module.
                            You can create your own project using Angular CLI, this command allows you to quickly create
                            an
                            Angular application like - generate components, services, pipes, directive, classes, and
                            modules, and so on as per your requirements.
                        </p>

                        Create your own component (login) using below command line â€“

                        <div class="terminal">
                            <pre>ng g component login</pre>
                        </div>
                        After executing the above Angular CLI command in your project directory, the result looks like

                        <div class="terminal">
                            <pre>D:\Angular\DemoApp>ng g component login</pre>
