# Angular Interview Questions

A complete guideline to prepare for angular interviews. Also, you can use these questions to verify your expertise in angular. 


## Assess Your Skill Level
The most important step is knowing how you compare to other job seekers. Pinpoint areas where you are weaker, and spend the time necessary to make improvements. Google is your friend.


## Know the Interviewer
Do yourself a favorâ€”Google the interviewer. Look at his/her Linkedin profile. Check his/her youtube videos, crappy old blog that hasn't been updated in years, and github profile. After your research, try to put the interviewer in one of the following categories:
1. Lazy interviewers wil ask about terminology. Sometimes they just Google and ask questions from there. If your interviewer is older and out of touch with the current development landscape, there is a greater chance that he/she will ask questions related to terminology.
2. More modest and nicer interviewers will be interested in what you know and whether you can get the job done. For this kind of interviewer look at the How category questions (I'm unsure what you are trying to say here)
3. Experienced interviewers (those who have been senior developers for a long time and have recently updated blogs and videos) want to know that you can think critically, and he will be interested in your process for decision making. These interviewers love to prove you wrong. One important tip: don't try to prove them wrong.

Researching relevant team members on LinkedIn and github can be useful as well.


## Further help - Novice Level

At this level an interviewer wants to know whether the interviewee is a coachable self-learner. Hence, he/she might ask questions about basic terminology, your ability to build a simple app, and your comprehension of basic concepts
